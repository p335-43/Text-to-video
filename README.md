# Video Generation with Diffusers

This project demonstrates how to generate a video from text prompts using the `diffusers` library by Hugging Face. It utilizes a pre-trained model to create video frames and then compiles them into a video file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- `diffusers`
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `torch`
- `google-colab` (for downloading files in Google Colab)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate torch google-colab
